### Hi!

Just a random internet guy who does random stuff. Here's what I have done and do:
- ![Syntax Highlighting](https://github.com/Reylyer/syntax-highlighting-notasi-algoritmik-inggriani-liem) - A very old project from when I first started programming. I just wanted to try making a quality of life solution for my college's programming language, *notasi algoritmik*. (badly implemented)
- ![Compiler](https://github.com/Reylyer/shariyl-compiler-collection-python) - The sequel of syntax highlighting for *notasi algoritmik*. I've only been able to create the lexer and tokenizer; I can't wrap my head around the AST stuff.
- ![Competitive Programing](https://github.com/Reylyer/not-so-competitive) - My solution to competitive programming on many platform.
- ![College](https://github.com/orgs/Tugasnya-Givandra/repositories) - My college stuff, tasks and many small project with my friends.
- ![My first game](https://github.com/orgs/Shariyl-Corporation/teams/decel-studios/repositories) - A (not so) simple game simulating as a police. Inspired by siap 86 (television show) and Papers, Please. 

Really interested in cloud infrastructure, networking, and security!
